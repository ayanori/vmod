If the repo is made public vmod can be installed from Github with:  
pip install git+https://github.com/uafgeotools/vmod  
  
There is probably a way to make that work with a private repo too (need to point point pip to ssh key?).  
  
Can test install from local version by pointing pip to it:  
pip install /path/to/your/vmod
